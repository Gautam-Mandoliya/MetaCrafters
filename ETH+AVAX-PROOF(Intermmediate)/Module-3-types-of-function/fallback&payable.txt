Introduction to Fallback Functions
Fallback functions have following features:

Called when a non-existent function is called on the contract
Required to be marked external
Has no name, no arguments, no return and cannot be marked payable
Defined once per contract
Throws exception if the contract receives plain Ether without data
Limited to 2300 gas when called by another function
Introduction to Payable Functions
Payable functions are used whenever you want your smart contract code to accept Ether from users. So, if your function wants to accept Ether, we need to use payable functions

Payable functions have the following features:

Allows accepting Ether from a caller
Fails if the sender has not provided Ether
Other functions do not accept Ether, only payable functions allow it
Functions and addresses declared payable can receive Ether in the contract
