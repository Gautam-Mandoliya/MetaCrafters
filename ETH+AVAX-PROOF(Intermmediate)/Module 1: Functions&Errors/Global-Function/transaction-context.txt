There are functions that exist in the global namespace, which are used mainly to provide information about the transactions in the network. 
There are two such main functions defined as part of the transaction context.
These are:

tx.gasprice: Returns the gas price of the transaction sent by the sender as part of the transaction
tx.origin: Returns the address of the original sender of the transaction
