There are several in-built functions that exist in the global namespace, which are used mainly to provide information about the blocks in the blockchain. The global functions defined in the block context are:

block.coinbase: Returns the address of the miner rather than the currently mined block
block.difficulty: Returns the difficulty at the time when the current block was mined
block.timestamp: Returns the timestamp at which the current block was mined
block.gaslimit: Returns the total gaslimit of all the transactions mined in the current block
block.number: Returns the number of the newest block in the blockchain
